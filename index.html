        <p>: Each person has different hobbies, and doing different things gives them joy. Baking is something that gives me comfort and helps me relax. I tried baking after entering college. At first, it was a little stressful, but then I started learning more and more. After a hectic day at college, it helps to relax you. Another thing that helps me relax is reading books. I started reading books when I was in school, and over the years, the habit is something that has helped me learn a lot.</p>

The merchants pay the affiliate an amount based on the actions performed by the users on their matter, which is fixed beforehand. Payment is based on performance thus the merchants spend only when they get desired results.            </p>
