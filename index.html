        <p>: Each person has different hobbies, and doing different things gives them joy. Baking is something that gives me comfort and helps me relax. I tried baking after entering college. At first, it was a little stressful, but then I started learning more and more. After a hectic day at college, it helps to relax you. Another thing that helps me relax is reading books. I started reading books when I was in school, and over the years, the habit is something that has helped me learn a lot.</p>
